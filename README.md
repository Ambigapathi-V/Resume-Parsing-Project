# Resume-Parsing-Project
The main goal of this project is to develop an NLP model that automates the extraction of key information from resumes using Named Entity Recognition (NER). The output will provide recruiters with structured data (e.g., Name, Education, Skills, Contact Info) from resumes, streamlining the resume screening process.
